<h1>Project Title: Hospital Management Dashboard</h1>

Description:
    The Hospital Management Dashboard is a console-based application designed to streamline patient management tasks in a healthcare setting. This system allows users to perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting patient records efficiently. Built using C#, the application interacts with a SQL Server database to store patient details, including ID, name, age, and illness. The user-friendly interface provides a simple menu-driven approach, making it accessible for hospital staff to manage patient information seamlessly. Key features include data validation for patient IDs, a structured DAO (Data Access Object) layer for database operations, and robust error handling to ensure smooth operation.
